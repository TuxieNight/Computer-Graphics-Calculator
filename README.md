This project answers basic computer graphics questions related to matrix and vector multiplication, vector normalization, barycentric interpolation, bilinear interpolation, converting between different types of curve representations, finding a point on a curve given its basis functions and control points, calculating curve tangents, connecting two different curves with C(1) or G(1) continuity, splitting a curve with Decastlejau, interpolating many line segments, applying Arc-Length parameterization, applying transformations (rotations, translates, and scaling) in 2D and 3D, converting between different types of rotation representations, mapping textures, and shading.

The content in the CS559-Three, css, and libs folders were provided by the instructors of the class CS559 at UW-Madison. The rest was developed by Peyton and Riley Howardsmith in 2025.

Note from Instructors:

Students should run a local web server and start with the `index.html` page.
The html files may not work as "files" without a local server.
