The content in the CS559-Three, css, and libs folders were provided by the instructors of the class CS559 at UW-Madison. The rest was developed by Peyton and Riley Howardsmith in 2025.

This project answers basic computer graphics questions related to matrix and vector multiplication, vector normalization, barycentric interpolation, bilinear interpolation, converting between different types of curve representations, finding a point on a curve given its basis functions and control points, calculating curve tangents, connecting two different curves with C(1) or G(1) continuity, splitting a curve with Decastlejau, interpolating many line segments, applying Arc-Length parameterization, applying transformations (rotations, translates, and scaling) in 2D and 3D, converting between different types of rotation representations, mapping textures, and shading.
